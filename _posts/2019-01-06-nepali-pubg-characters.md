**PlayerUnknown Battlegrounds (PUBG)** was one of the most popular games of 2018. Though I have not played it, I really like the character design of the game. 

I wanted to make similar character in Nepali dress up, and started thinking about the ideas. The obvious choice was to make a character wearing *Daura Suruwal*. As I started creating it, several other ideas came into my mind. 

Here are some of the concept designs of PUBG character in Nepali lifestyle.

## PUBG Character in Nepali dress
Well battling in Daura Suruwal may not be easy though!
