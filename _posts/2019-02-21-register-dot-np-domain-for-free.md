So you are planning to create a website and want to get a domain name for free? Or you are planning to start your blog but dont know where to start from. Be it a personal website, or a business website, you can get .np domains for free in Nepal. The only thing required is scanned copy of your citizenship, and a cover letter.

## What is .np domain name?

.np domain name is the [Country code top-level domain (ccTLD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_code_top-level_domain), reserved for Nepal. [Mercantile Communicationa PVT. LTD.](http://www.mos.com.np/) has the right to distribute .np domains in Nepal.

## How to get then?

The registration is quite straight forward.

1. Go to https://register.com.np/ and check if the domain name you want is available. You can select from a various sets of domains such as `.com.np`, `.info.np`, etc.

    If the domain is not available, try a new one.

2. If the domain is available, click `Register now`. It will take it to the login page. If you have not registered before, click `Create user`.

3. Fill all the details, and click `Create account`. Verfication link will be sent to your email. Go to your email, and click `Verify`. It will take you to the login page. Login with your newly created credentials.

4. Next you need to fill the domain request form. The tricky part is `Name server` section. If you have purchased a hosting package, you will get nameservers from your hosting provider. If not, you can use free nameservers till you get a new one: `ns1.afraid.org` and `ns2.afraid.org`

    > You can also use Cloudflare's nameservers as well, which has many benefits. For that, login to [Cloudflare](https://cloudflare.com), go to `DNS`, and under `Cloudflare Nameservers` section there will be the nameservers. Copy those in the two nameservers section.

    Then fill the `Administrative contact` and `Technical contact` information, which is quite straight forward.

5. Submit documents

    Make sure you have scanned copy of either your citizenship, passport or license. 
    An extra thing you require is a cover letter requesting the domain name.

    here is a sample of the cover letter:

    ```

        Date: 2019-02-21

        To,
